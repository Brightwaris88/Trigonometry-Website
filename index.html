            <h1>Welcome to Trigonometry Website</h1>
            <p>Trigonometry is one of the important branches in the history of mathematics that deals with the study of the relationship between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. This concept is given by the Greek mathematician Hipparchus. In this article, we are going to learn the basics of trigonometry such as trigonometry functions, ratios, trigonometry table, formulas and many solved examples.</p>
            <p>Trigonometry Ratios-Sine, Cosine, Tangent. The trigonometric ratios of a triangle are also called the trigonometric functions. Sine, cosine, and tangent are 3 important trigonometric functions and are abbreviated as sin, cos and tan. Let us see how are these ratios or functions, evaluated in case of a right-angled triangle.
            Consider a right-angled triangle, where the longest side is called the hypotenuse, and the sides opposite to the hypotenuse are referred to as the adjacent and opposite sides.</p>
