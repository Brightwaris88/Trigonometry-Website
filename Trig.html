    <h1>What is Trigonometry?</h1>
    <p>Trigonometry is one of the most important branches of mathematics that finds huge application in diverse fields. The branch called “Trigonometry” basically deals with the study of the relationship between the sides and angles of a right-angle triangle. Hence, it helps to find the missing or unknown angles or sides of a right triangle using the trigonometric formulas, functions, or trigonometric identities.</p>
    <p>In trigonometry, the angles can be either measured in degrees or radians. Some of the most commonly used trigonometric angles for calculations are 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°.</p>
