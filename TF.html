    <h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>

    <p>Trigonometric functions are functions that relate the angles of a triangle to the lengths of its sides. The most common trigonometric functions are sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These functions are essential in understanding various concepts in mathematics, especially in geometry and trigonometry.</p>

    <h3>1. Graphs of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
    <p>The graphs of trigonometric functions show how these functions change with different angles. The most commonly graphed functions are sine, cosine, and tangent.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sine and Cosine Graphs</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The graphs of the sine and cosine functions are wavy and periodic, meaning they repeat their shape every 360° (or 2π radians).</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Sine Graph:</strong> Starts at 0, reaches a maximum of 1 at 90° (π/2 radians), goes back to 0 at 180° (π radians), reaches a minimum of -1 at 270° (3π/2 radians), and returns to 0 at 360° (2π radians).</p>

        <p><strong>Cosine Graph:</strong> Starts at 1, decreases to 0 at 90° (π/2 radians), reaches a minimum of -1 at 180° (π radians), goes back to 0 at 270° (3π/2 radians), and returns to 1 at 360° (2π radians).</p>
        <img src="cosG.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333">
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tangent Graph</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tangent function graph has a different shape; it repeats every 180° (π radians).</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p>The graph of the tangent function has vertical asymptotes (lines the graph approaches but never touches) at 90° (π/2 radians), 270° (3π/2 radians), etc., where the function is undefined.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>2. Solving Trigonometric Equations</h3>
    <p>Solving trigonometric equations involves finding the angles that make a trigonometric equation true.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Example</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
        <p>Consider the equation <strong>sin x = 0.5</strong>. To solve this, you need to find the angle x for which the sine is 0.5.</p>
        <p>Using the unit circle or a calculator, you find that <strong>x = 30°</strong> (or x = π/6 radians) is a solution. However, since sine is periodic, <strong>x = 30° + 360°n</strong> or <strong>x = 150° + 360°n</strong> (where n is any integer) are also solutions.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>General Approach</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To solve more complex equations, you often need to use identities, inverse functions, or graphical methods.</p>

    <h3>3. Maximum and Minimum Points of Trigonometric Functions</h3>
    <p>The maximum and minimum points of trigonometric functions refer to the highest and lowest values these functions can reach.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sine and Cosine Functions</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The maximum value of the sine and cosine functions is 1, and the minimum value is -1.</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p>For example, in the sine function <strong>y = sin x</strong>, the maximum point is at y = 1 and occurs at x = 90° (π/2 radians), while the minimum point is at y = -1 and occurs at x = 270° (3π/2 radians).</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tangent Function</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tangent function does not have a maximum or minimum value because it can increase or decrease without bound. However, it has points where the function crosses the x-axis (called zeros) and vertical asymptotes where the function is undefined.</p>

    <p>These concepts are fundamental for understanding how trigonometric functions behave and are applied in solving various mathematical problems.</p>
